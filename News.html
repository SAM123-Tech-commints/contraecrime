                        <p>A new report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warns that scam calls originating in Asia have become a global problem, fueled by organized crime networks that have turned fraud into a multi-billion-dollar industry.</p>
                        <p>The UNODC report, published today, highlights how Southeast Asian cybercrime groups, initially focused on regional targets, have expanded their operations worldwide, using advanced technology and human trafficking to scale their fraudulent activities.</p>
                        <p>"These groups operate like multinational corporations, with sophisticated structures and global reach," the report states. It estimates that such scams generated $40 billion in 2024 alone, with call centers in countries like Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines playing a central role.</p>
                        <p>The report also notes the role of forced labor, with tens of thousands of people trafficked into scam compounds, where they are coerced into making fraudulent calls under threat of violence.</p>

                        <p>According to the UNODC, these operations, often based in countries like Cambodia, Laos, and the Philippines, have grown from local scams into a $40 billion industry in 2024, driven by advanced technology and the exploitation of trafficked labor.</p>
                        <p>"The scale of these operations is unprecedented," said a UNODC spokesperson. "They use everything from fake investment schemes to romance scams, targeting victims globally through phone calls, text messages, and online platforms."</p>
                        <p>The report also highlights the human cost, with an estimated 200,000 people trafficked into scam compounds across Southeast Asia, forced to perpetrate fraud under brutal conditions.</p>

                        <p>"These are not small-time operations anymore," the report notes. "They are highly organized, transnational crime syndicates that generated an estimated $40 billion in 2024, with no signs of slowing down."</p>
                        <p>The UNODC also emphasizes the human trafficking element, noting that many workers in these scam centers are victims themselves, forced to participate under threat of violence or death.</p>

                        <p>MANILA – The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Tuesday warned the public against online scammers offering tour packages that appear too good to be true as the summer travel season peaks.</p>
                        <p>PNP Chief Gen. Rommel Francisco Marbil issued the reminder as the police force’s Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG) arrested 45 persons for cybercrimes from April 11 to 17 in line with President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.’s directive to intensify the campaign against cybercrimes.</p>
                        <p>“We urge everyone to verify the legitimacy of travel agencies and booking platforms before making any transactions,” Marbil said in a statement.</p>
                        <p>“To cybercriminals preying on innocent citizens, especially during this peak travel season, be warned: the PNP is actively monitoring, patrolling, and ready to act. There will be no safe space for scammers in the digital world,” he added.</p>
                        <p>The PNP-ACG conducted 313 cyber patrolling activities and carried out 13 digital forensic examinations from April 11 to 17, resulting in the arrest of 45, including 32 through entrapment operations.</p>
                        <p>The ACG called on the public to stay vigilant and immediately report any suspicious or harmful online activity through the ACG’s official hotlines and verified social media accounts.</p>
                        <p>Marbil said the PNP remains steadfast in its mission to ensure that every Filipino enjoys a safer and more secure cyberspace under the Bagong Pilipinas framework.</p>
                        <p>He lauded ACG’s consistent and high-impact performance, emphasizing the importance of public trust and law enforcement’s evolving role in cyberspace.</p>
                        <p>The PNP chief also commended the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group’s (CIDG) intensified operations in apprehending the 37 wanted individuals and fugitives on April 14.</p>
                        <p>“I salute our CIDG teams nationwide for their relentless commitment and swift action in taking 37 fugitives off the streets in just one day. Your bravery and perseverance in carrying out this difficult task not only strengthen public safety but also bring hope to victims still waiting for justice,” he said.</p>
                        <p>He assured the public that the CIDG remains relentless in its efforts to account for and arrest all wanted persons and criminals nationwide.</p>

                    <div class="news-details">
                        <p>MANILA: The Philippines has signed a new security agreement with the UAE to tackle transnational and organized crime, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>Signed by Philippine Interior Secretary Juanito Victor Remulla and UAE Interior Minister Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the new deal focuses on cybercrime, drug trafficking, and human trafficking.</p>
                        <p>“Transnational crimes with global networks powered by new technologies and the ease of cross-border movement of persons and criminal syndicates need more international cooperation and partnerships,” Alfonso Ver, Philippine ambassador to the UAE, told Arab News on Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>“This is one concrete step to address the growing menace above … We have gone into new and heretofore unexplored areas of bilateral cooperation, moving beyond the issues of OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers), migration, and oil,” Ver added.</p>
                        <p>The Philippines and the UAE celebrated 50 years of diplomatic relations last year. The two countries have been working to expand security ties over the past few years, with discussions ongoing for a wide-ranging bilateral defense pact.</p>
                        <p>In 2021, the Philippines posted a defense attache in the UAE, making it the only country in the Middle East where Manila has such representation. The two countries also signed several treaties on extradition, mutual legal assistance, and transfer of prisoners in February.</p>
                        <p>Ver said the new agreement was a “milestone” that provides a “strategic framework” that will help guide Philippine-UAE “future engagements in a more structured, sustainable, and effective” manner. It is also expected to promote the exchange of best practices and expertise.</p>
                        <p>“We discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations between the two friendly countries and develop cooperation in the security and police fields,” Sheikh Saif said in a post on X, referring to his meeting with Remulla.</p>
                        <p>“This underscores our shared commitment to supporting effective international institutional cooperation to enhance the security and stability of societies,” he added.</p>
                        <p>Cybercrime and trafficking have been growing concerns for countries like the Philippines. More than 200 Filipinos were among several thousand people freed in late February and March from online scam centers run by syndicates operating along Myanmar’s border with Thailand, where many of them are believed to have been recruited and trafficked by criminal gangs.</p>
                        <p>Lured by well-paid job offers in Thailand, they were released in a weeks-long, highly publicized crackdown by Thai, Myanmar, and Chinese forces.</p>

                        <p>MANILA – Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Henry Aguda on Monday endorsed a sweeping policy that targets online disinformation, cyber scams, and other online threats.</p>
                        <p>The policy is part of the upcoming “Good Vibes sa Internet” initiative that aims to build a safer and more trustworthy online environment by eliminating digital threats and protecting the public from online abuse, according to a news release.</p>
                        <p>“We must create a safer and more responsible cyberspace for every Filipino. We can no longer stand idly by as false information erodes the trust that binds our nation,” Aguda said during his first meeting with the executive committee as chair of the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC).</p>
                        <p>The policy builds on the Cybercrime Prevention Act and introduces new measures such as the formation of a multi-agency task force to “swiftly respond” against online disinformation.</p>
                        <p>“Through digital bayanihan (cooperation), the DICT will work closely with social media platforms, law enforcement, and civil society to detect and dismantle digital lies before they spread,” he said.</p>
                        <p>Aside from disinformation or fake news, the policy will address the escalating threats of cyberterrorism by reclassifying certain cybercrimes as acts of cyberterrorism.</p>
                        <p>“This move aims to deter malicious actors, recognize cybercrimes as continuing offenses, and strengthen national security and public safety in today’s increasingly digital landscape,” he said.</p>
                        <p>Aguda said the policies form part of the government’s broader commitment to shaping an online space that “fosters meaningful engagement, upholds truth, and safeguards the collective well-being of every Filipino online.”</p>
                        <p>“Cybercriminals must be held accountable with the full force of the law. We are taking a strong stance to ensure that the digital space is no place for fear, fraud, or extremism,” he said.</p>

                        <p>The forum, organized by the Philippine Information Agency (PIA), featured experts from the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) who warned of the increasing sophistication of these scams, often targeting unsuspecting individuals through fake messages and fraudulent links.</p>
                        <p>"These threats are evolving rapidly, and media professionals need to be equipped to identify and report them," said a DICT spokesperson. The event also included workshops on spotting fraudulent communications and protecting personal data online.</p>
                        <p>Participants were urged to educate the public on safe digital practices, such as avoiding suspicious links and verifying the authenticity of messages before taking action.</p>

                        <p>MANILA – The Cybercrime Investigation Coordination Council (CICC) is considering forming a dedicated task force to go after online and text scammers, an official said Wednesday.</p>
                        <p>Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Assistant Secretary Renato Paraiso said the council would meet later in the day to discuss the plan.</p>
                        <p>"We're strengthening the CICC in terms of investigation and apprehension. The council, led by the DICT Secretary and joined by other agencies, will meet today to discuss forming a task force to crack down on online and text scams," Paraiso said in a televised interview.</p>
                        <p>He also said the CICC is enhancing its Inter-Agency Response Center (I-ARC) Hotline 1326, where the public can report online scam incidents.</p>
                        <p>According to Paraiso, while the SIM Card Registration Act has helped discourage text scams by removing anonymity, many scammers have adapted by shifting to online messaging apps that don't require SIM registration.</p>
                        <p>"The SIM card registration removed their anonymity, but scammers have adapted. They no longer use calls or texts. They've moved to internet-based services like Viber and Messenger, which don't require valid SIM cards," he said.</p>
                        <p>Paraiso reminded the public to stay alert for online scams, avoid clicking suspicious links, and never share one-time passwords (OTPs), which scammers can use to access financial accounts and records.</p>

                        <p>During the third House Tri-Committee hearing on Friday, March 21, Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong (Lanao del Sur, 1st District) asked government agencies responsible for investigating false information on social media to explain how an ordinary citizen can report and navigate the process.</p>
                        <p>Agencies with this capability include the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the PNP Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT).</p>
                        <p>Many are familiar with the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act 10175), which penalizes online libel — defamatory statements made through digital platforms — under Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
                        <p>However, police colonel Andres Simbajon Jr., deputy director for administration of the PNP-ACG, told the committee that "fake news" can still be legally addressed, as it is classified as a crime under the Revised Penal Code.</p>
                        <p>One in particular is Article 154, which penalizes the "unlawful use of means of publication and unlawful utterances."</p>
                        <p>The Revised Penal Code prescribes a penalty of arresto mayor — imprisonment ranging from one month and one day to six months — for unlawful publication perspective, this comes with an additional fine ranging from P40,000 to P200,000.</p>
                        <p>Police lieutenant colonel Anacleto Daliva, assistant chief of the PNP-ACG's legal affairs division, explained that false information can also be penalized under the Cybercrime Prevention Act through Section 6, which covers crimes under the Revised Penal Code and special laws when committed through a computer system.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, core cybercrimes such as libel and online fraud fall under Section 4. "These are crimes where perpetrators use IT equipment, such as a cellphone or computer," Daliva said.</p>

                        <p>ACG director Brig. Gen. Bernard Yang said the figure is higher by 240.54 percent compared to the 37 people arrested in January.</p>

                        <p>The top five offenses committed by the suspects are estafa, grave coercion, libel, violation of Republic Act 11934, the Subscriber Identity Module Registration Act, and RA 12010 or the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act.</p>

                        <p>RIYADH: Saudi Arabia was among the top 10 countries targeted by cybercriminals in 2024, with digital fraud attempts surging by 35 percent compared to the previous year, according to a new report by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.</p>
                        <p>The report, released on Wednesday, highlighted that the Kingdom faced over 20 million cyber attacks last year, with phishing emails, ransomware, and online scams being the most common threats.</p>
                        <p>"The rapid digital transformation in Saudi Arabia has made it a lucrative target for cybercriminals," said a Kaspersky spokesperson. The report noted that many attacks were linked to international crime syndicates operating out of Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>Saudi authorities have responded by strengthening cybersecurity measures, including public awareness campaigns and increased collaboration with global tech firms to combat digital fraud.</p>

                        <p>MANILA – The Department of Justice's Office of Cybercrime and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) are in talks to collaborate in various projects to strengthen criminal justice, especially on the intensified enforcement of cybercrime laws in the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>In a news release on Thursday, the DOJ said among the activities that the two agencies intend to undertake is increasing the government's pool of digital forensic experts and boosting their capacities of cybercrime investigators and prosecutors.</p>
                        <p>DOJ Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla highlighted this need due to the steady increase in cybercrimes and cyber-enabled offenses or incidents in the country.</p>
                        <p>To negotiate on the details of this partnership, Remulla will be leading a small delegation of DOJ officials to the UNODC headquarters in Vienna, Austria to sit down with its Executive Director, Ghada Fathi Waly.</p>
                        <p>The delegation will also visit UNODC's Crime Laboratory.</p>
                        <p>The meeting and visit will be conducted on the sidelines of the 68th Session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs on March 10 to 14.</p>
                        <p>The DOJ said the activities are in line with the Marcos administration's commitment to human rights and the rule of law.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Undersecretary Jesse Hermogenes Andres, head of DOJ's Law Enforcement Cluster, is leading the conversations with UNODC's team in the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>Andres said he envisions to institutionalize the government's ability to procure and utilize the necessary digital forensic tools and software applications used in cybercrime investigations.</p>
                        <p>He said funding for the renewal of licenses of these important investigative tools must always be given priority.</p>
                        <p>The DOJ and the UNODC are looking at signing a comprehensive memorandum of agreement to cover the various justice sector programs, including prison reform and forensics, in May this year. (PNA)</p>

                        <p>Generative AI is starting to transform many sectors, both legitimate and illicit. Criminals have been early adopters, exploiting technology like deepfakes to turbo-charge existing methods to commit cybercrime and fraud—and invent entirely new ones. AI has made it increasingly challenging to verify the true identities of customers, investors, vendors, and even colleagues.</p>
                        <p>Companies and their counsel need to understand how to avoid deepfake-related risks, how to address them effectively when they arise, and how to stay within the bounds of their ethical responsibilities. Our panel, comprised of both current and former government officials, will discuss:</p>

                        <p>The agency also announced P198 million in losses from the recorded cybercrime incidents.</p>
                        <p>But this does not necessarily translate to a rise in cybercrime prevalence, as CICC Executive Director Alexander K. Ramos described the increase as an indicator of "growing cybercrime awareness of the public and their willingness to report".</p>

                        <p>MANILA – The Department of Justice (DOJ) will embark on capacity-building this year to improve its anti-cybercrime efforts, according to a senior official.</p>
                        <p>In an interview on PTV-4's "Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon" on Wednesday, DOJ Undersecretary Raul Vasquez said that for 2025, they will "take major strides in strengthening the DOJ's fight against cybercrime by conducting advanced technological and forensic trainings for its personnel and law enforcement units."</p>
                        <p>The DOJ has an Office of Cybercrime (OOC) created under Republic Act No. 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 that serves as the central authority in all matters relating to international mutual assistance and extradition for cybercrime and cyber-related matters.</p>
                        <p>The OOC also acts as "the focal agency in formulating and implementing law enforcement investigation and prosecution strategies in curbing cybercrime and cyber-related offenses nationwide," according to the DOJ.</p>
                        <p>Vasquez made the statement following the arrest of a foreign national and two Filipinos suspected of engaging in months-long electronic intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance (ISR) operations in key military and civilian infrastructures in the country.</p>
                        <p>The DOJ confirmed that it is pursuing other members of the group who may have procured equipment used in the eavesdropping operations, even as the military said it is monitoring the role played by Philippine Online Gaming Operators (POGOs) in the alleged spying activities.</p>
                        <p>The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) on Wednesday likewise announced the arrest of eight foreigners in Parañaque City allegedly engaged in online phishing operations.</p>

                        <p>A Malaysian national believed to be a key supplier of a device used in large-scale text scams was arrested in a joint operation by the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) and the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC).</p>
                        <p>Authorities identified the suspect as the alleged leader of a syndicate selling International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers, electronic tools designed to trace and intercept mobile phone communications.</p>
                        <p>The CICC began monitoring the suspect's company in October last year, carefully tracking its activities until they were certain of the suspect's involvement before executing the operation.</p>
                        <p>IMSI catchers, also known as "Stingrays" or rogue cell towers, function by imitating legitimate cell towers to deceive nearby mobile devices into connecting with them. Once connected, the device collects IMSI numbers, enabling the operator to track location, monitor activity, and intercept text messages, calls, and data traffic.</p>
                        <p>Investigators revealed that these devices are commonly used in text scams, tricking victims into sharing personal information and enabling large-scale fraud operations.</p>
                        <p>"This arrest is a significant breakthrough in our fight against cybercrime and text scams that target the public," said a CICC representative.</p>
                        <p>Authorities vowed to continue cracking down on syndicates using advanced technology to commit crimes, urging the public to remain vigilant against scams.</p>

                        <p>MANILA – Operatives of the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) have arrested four persons involved in the illegal online sale of pre-registered subscriber identity module (SIM) cards in separate operations in Laguna province and Quezon City.</p>
                        <p>In a statement Friday, ACG acting chief Brig. Gen. Bernard Yang said cyberpatrolling activities led to an engagement with the online sellers and their eventual arrest on Jan. 13 to 14.</p>
                        <p>The Calabarzon police's anti-cybercrime unit spotted a suspect advertising online a bundle of a fully verified e-wallet account and a SIM card priced at PHP800.</p>
                        <p>An officer arranged to meet up with the suspect and an accomplice, both of whom the ACG did not identify, which resulted in their arrest in Cabuyao town, Laguna at 4:40 p.m. on Jan. 13.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the ACG's Cyber Financial Crime Unit (CFCU) said another suspect, alias "JP," was selling an e-wallet account with an automated teller machine (ATM) card as well as an online banking account worth PHP3,000.</p>
                        <p>The suspect was arrested after meeting up with a police officer who acted as a buyer along Mayon Street in Quezon City at around 12:58 p.m. on Jan. 14.</p>
                        <p>Around 2:32 p.m. on the same date, the anti-cybercrime units of Northern Police District and Quezon City Police District arrested a suspect, alias Arvin, for selling his registered SIM card, along General Araneta Avenue in Cubao, Quezon City.</p>
                        <p>The SIM card was linked to a verified e-wallet account and was priced at PHP2,300, the ACG said in a separate report.</p>
                        <p>All four suspects were charged with violations of the SIM Registration Act, the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act, and the Cybercrime Prevention Act.</p>
                        <p>The SIM card can be used for text scams or to create a social media account for scamming activities.</p>
                        <p>Yang reminded the public that the illegal online sale of SIM cards is punishable by law, with significant fines and imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>"It is crucial to adhere to the law and avoid involvement in such online illegal transactions to protect oneself and prevent the spread of cybercrime," he added. (PNA)</p>
