    <div class="news-details">
        <p>The operator of Masungi Georeserve, a well-known conservation site in the Philippines, has strongly denied allegations related to a long-running labor dispute involving a former caretaker.</p>
        <p>The case, which has lasted for seven years, involves an alleged former employee who filed a claim against First United Constructors Corporation and Gina Lopez Dumaliang for ₱4,700 in back pay.</p>
        <p>The dispute has drawn public attention following commentary by columnist Victor Agustin, who raised concerns about labor practices at the site.</p>
        <p>RELATED STORY: ADVERTISEMENT Agustin noted that although the caretaker won favorable rulings from the Court of Appeals and the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), he declined reinstatement andsought work elsewhere, suggesting potential issues in how the organization treats its workers.</p>
        <p>Masungi issued a statement vehemently denying the claims.</p>
        <p>“This is false information! This person has never been an employee of Masungi, nor was he involved in Masungi in any way,” the statement said, calling on the public and media to help combat disinformation against environmental defenders.</p>

        <p>BUSINESS Google eyes deeper ties with Phl on digital infra, workforce dev't DTI Raffy Ayeng Published on: 19 May 2025, 17:19 The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is exploring a strategic partnership with Google to strengthen the Philippines’ digital infrastructure and workforce capabilities.</p>
        <p>Trade Secretary Cristina Roque met with Google Vice President and Global Head for Government Affairs and Public Policy Karan Bhatia on 15 May in Jeju, South Korea, during the APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade Meeting.</p>
        <p>Discussions centered on advancing data center infrastructure, enhancing internet connectivity, and expanding cooperation in digital skills development.</p>
        <p>“The Philippines stands ready to be a vital partner in the global digital value chain. With our young, tech-savvy population and rapidly strengthening infrastructure, we are laying the foundation for inclusive innovation and sustainable growth,” said Roque.</p>
        <p>ADVERTISEMENT The trade secretary highlighted the country’s growing role in electronics, semiconductors, and machinery exports, as well as its potential to support advanced manufacturing operations for major tech firms like Google.</p>
        <p>She also cited Google’s contributions to subsea internet cable investments and support for the IT-BPM sector since it began operations in the country in 2013.</p>
        <p>With 110 million citizens and strong digital habits, the Philippines is becoming a key destination for hyperscaler firms.</p>
        <p>Roque pointed to government incentives through the CREATE MORE law and the country’s robust digital infrastructure, including 19 international subsea cables, 13 cable landing stations, over 840,000 km of domestic fiber optics, and 25 data centers with a total rack capacity of 19,000.</p>
        <p>Hyperscalers refer to large-scale data centers designed to handle massive volumes of data and support high-demand applications.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional on-site data centers, hyperscalers are built for scalability, enabling tech companies to deliver cloud services, storage, and computing power on a much larger and more efficient scale.</p>
        <p>These facilities are essential for supporting global digital platforms, including streaming, e-commerce, and enterprise solutions.</p>
        <p>Roque reaffirmed government support for hyperscaler growth through policies on talent development, intellectual property protection, and data privacy and cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>She also praised Google’s partnership with DTI on the Google Career Certificates program, now being implemented through more than 1,300 Negosyo Centers across 16 regions.</p>
        <p>The secretary called for deeper collaboration to enhance digital programs for MSMEs, especially women and youth entrepreneurs.</p>

        <p>MANILA – President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. on Saturday called on 266 members of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) “Siklab-Laya” Class of 2025 to stay “mentally sharp” amid the growing threat of cyber warfare.</p>
        <p>Speaking at the commencement rites at Fort del Pilar in Baguio City, Marcos reminded the cadets that modern warfare now extends beyond traditional domains.</p>
        <p>“Beyond recognition, the most important lesson you carry is the understanding that warfare today goes beyond land, seas, and skies,” he said, noting that the new battleground takes place in cyberspace.</p>
        <p>“We have battles that are invisible to radar – ones that take place in cyberspace, in protecting information, in safeguarding the environment, and in helping communities during crises.”</p>
        <p>He reminded the graduates that physical strength and agility are no longer enough and “what we need just as much are your mental sharpness and your compassion.”</p>
        <p>Marcos advised them to apply what they have learned during their training and courses in the academy, especially in such areas as artificial intelligence, drone technology, strategic thinking, and ethical leadership.</p>

            <h2>Study: PH cybersecurity readiness remains low at 6%</h2>
            <div class="news-meta">Newsbytes.PH | May 16, 2025</div>

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-down toggle-icon"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="news-details">
        <p>According to the 2025 Cybersecurity Readiness Index of tech giant Cisco, only 6 percent of organizations in Philippines have achieved the “Mature” level of readiness required to effectively withstand today’s cybersecurity threats.</p>
        <p>This is a slight increase from last year’s rankings, in which 1% of organizations in Philippines were designated as Mature.</p>
        <p>This demonstrates that despite a slight improvement from last year, cybersecurity preparedness remains low as hyperconnectivity and AI introduce new complexities for security practitioners, the report said.</p>
        <p>The study said that the lack of cybersecurity readiness in Philippines is alarming as 75% of respondents anticipate business disruptions from cyber incidents within the next 12 to 24 months.</p>
        <p>AI is revolutionizing security and escalating threat levels, with 8 in 10 organizations (85%) facing AI-related security incidents last year, it noted.</p>
        <p>However, only 71% of respondents are confident their employees fully understand AI related threats, and 59% believe their teams fully grasp how malicious actors are using AI to execute sophisticated attacks. This awareness gap leaves organizations critically exposed, the report added.</p>
        <p>“AI opens up new possibilities but also adds complexity to an already challenging security landscape. Over the past year, we have seen companies worldwide, including those in the Philippines, continue to grapple with evolving threats like the rise of shadow AI, talent shortages, and complex security infrastructures. This underscores the need for a different approach to security— one that not only leverages AI for security but also ensures AI itself is secure and scalable,” said Zaza Soriano-Nicart, managing director of Cisco Philippines.</p>

        <p>MANILA – National Security Adviser (NSA) Eduardo Año on Friday hailed the signing of the Arrangement Concerning Defense Cooperation between the Philippines and Germany, touting it as a "significant milestone" in the country's ongoing efforts to strengthen its national defense and security posture.</p>
        <p>"This agreement, signed by Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. and German Federal Minister of Defence Boris Pistorius in Berlin, represents a deepening of the longstanding relationship between our two nations, building on the 1974 Administrative Agreement that enabled training opportunities for members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in Germany," Año said in a press statement.</p>
        <p>Año, who is also director general of the National Security Council, said the expanded scope of this new arrangement covers cybersecurity, defense armament and logistics.</p>
        <p>It also includes United Nations peacekeeping efforts which reflect a shared commitment to mutual security, regional and global stability.</p>
        <p>"As we continue to navigate complex regional challenges, particularly in the West Philippine Sea, this agreement underscores the importance of fostering robust defense and security partnerships with like-minded nations that uphold the rules-based international order, sovereignty, and peaceful coexistence among nations," Año said.</p>

        <p>ANKARA – The Philippines Commission on Elections (COMELEC) website and precinct finder apps recorded over 3 million cyberattacks aimed at taking over the systems and to inject malicious information during this week's crucial mid-term polls, local media reported Thursday.</p>
        <p>They were the subject of cyberattacks from May 11-14, covering the eve of the elections to the canvassing of votes, the Manila Times reported, citing Comelec spokesman John Rex Laudiangco.</p>
        <p>Laudiangco said the COMELEC precinct finder registered 76.81 million visits, with at least 1.45 million identified as hacking attacks.</p>
        <p>The COMELEC website registered 113.41 million visits with mitigated confirmed attacks of 1.75 million, he added.</p>
        <p>None of the attempts were successful because of the security measures and constant monitoring by the Comelec Cybersecurity Division and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), he added.</p>
        <p>Although most of the hacking attempts appeared to originate from abroad, the Comelec cybersecurity experts were convinced that the hackers were actually based in the Philippines, using foreign locations to mislead authorities, Laudiangco said.</p>

        <p>MANILA – The Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) said incidents of voyeurism in the first four months of 2025 have decreased by 39 percent.</p>
        <p>In a statement on Tuesday, PNP-ACG acting director Brig. Gen. Bernard Yang said the 86 incidents of voyeurism logged from Jan. 1 to May 1 are lower than the 141 recorded in the same period last year.</p>
        <p>Yang attributed the decrease to their ongoing public awareness initiatives through a series of dialogues, seminars, and informative social media campaigns.</p>
        <p>"These efforts have contributed to a decline in cybercrimes, particularly photo and video voyeurism, as more people become aware of the risks associated with sharing explicit content online," Yang said.</p>
        <p>He said the ACG continues to boost its proactive cyber patrolling and digital literacy campaign in line with President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.’s directive to beef up the government’s anti-cybercrime efforts.</p>
        <p>“The decrease in reported cybercrime cases reflects our collaborative efforts in promoting safer online environment, especially for the youth, who are among the most vulnerable to crimes like photo and video voyeurism. “We assure the public that the ACG remains fully committed to its mandate of eradicating cybercrime,” he said.</p>
        <p>Yang said from January to March 2025, the PNP ACG conducted a total of 360 police operations, including 193 entrapment operations and 131 service of warrants of arrest, which led to the arrest of 369 individuals involved in various cybercriminal activities.</p>

        <p>Comelec Spokesperson Atty. John Rex Laudiangco also said that these incidents are categorized as DIDOS or deliberated denial of service, which is a way or "crowding" the webpage so that voters can't access the site.</p>
        <p>"Meron pong 43.7 million na browse at visits sa webpage na yan. Out of the 43 million na yan, 14.11 million yung legitimate na nag-search ng kanilang presinto.

        <p>Only 6% of organizations in the Philippines are considered fully equipped to counter modern cybersecurity threats, according to Cisco’s 2025 Cybersecurity Readiness Index released on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The figure marks a slight improvement from 1% last year, but overall readiness remains low amid a growing threat landscape driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and increased connectivity.</p>
        <p>AI has emerged as both a tool for strengthening cybersecurity and a vector for new threats. Cisco said 85% of Philippine firms reported experiencing AI-related security incidents in the past year. However, only 71% of respondents believe their employees understand AI-related threats, while just 59% think their teams grasp how malicious actors use AI to conduct attacks.</p>
        <p>“As AI transforms the enterprise, we are dealing with an entirely new class of risks at unprecedented scale — putting even more pressure on our infrastructure and those who defend it,” said Jeetu Patel, Cisco’s chief product officer.</p>

            <p>MANILA – The inter-agency ‘Task Force KKK (Katotohanan, Katapatan, Katarungan) sa Halalan’ on Friday launched its new threat monitoring center that seeks to combat online disinformation and other election violations.</p>
            <p>During the launching ceremony at the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC) office in Diliman, Quezon City, Presidential Communications Office (PCO) Secretary Jay Ruiz said the facility seeks to protect the integrity of the elections.</p>
            <p>“Elections are the bedrock of democracy. President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has issued a directive to make this election clean and fair. It aims to safeguard the integrity of the 2025 national and local elections,” Ruiz said.</p>
            <p>He said there are reports of foreign state-sponsored groups that are attempting to influence the country’s elections.</p>
            <p>“Lalo tayong mag-ingat dahil eleksyon po ito. Ang pino-protektahan natin dito ay boto ng bawat Pilipino. Magkaisa po tayo, labanan natin ang fake news (Let’s be extra careful because this is the elections. We’re protecting the vote of every Filipino. Let’s work together to combat fake news),” Ruiz said.</p>
            <p>Analysts from various government agencies are housed within the facility and are tasked with gathering reports of disinformation or ‘fake news,’ malicious artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content, and other election violations under Commission on Elections (Comelec) Resolution No. 1164.</p>
            <p>After gathering reports, they will use their tools to determine whether an online post is false and considered a violation.</p>
            <p>Reports of vote-buying are said to be addressed within an hour, AI-generated content is detected within minutes using software tools, while disinformation posts are flagged, and a  to date, Task Force KKK has partnered with Meta, Google, TikTok, X, and other online platforms for the quick takedown of misinformation.</p>
            <p>In cases where disinformation has already spread, the task force will issue statements debunking false narratives.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Comelec Commissioner Nelson Celis clarified that posts that are not found to violate Resolution No. 1164 will not be taken down in respect of freedom of speech.</p>
            <p>“Ang online disinformation as an election offense ay may penalty of one to a maximum of six years imprisonment. Kaya kayong mga troll farms magtago-tago na kayo. Meron kaming tools para ma-trace ang origin ng mga posts na yan (Online disinformation as an election offense is penalized by one to six years imprisonment. That’s why troll farms should begin hiding, we have tools to trace the origin of such posts),” Celis said.</p>
            <p>He added Comelec’s efforts to combat online disinformation on the elections began in 2023 as ‘Task Force Kontra Fake News.’</p>
            <p>In Malacañang, Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary and Palace Press Officer Claire Castro said the 24/7 threat monitoring center is proof that the government acts quickly and is united when the truth is at stake.</p>
            <p>“Ito ay isang real time digital command post na handang tukuyin, pigilin at tapusin ang (It is a real-time digital command post ready to identify, deter, and end) online misinformation and disinformation,” Castro said in a press briefing.</p>

            <p>MANILA — The Philippine government is now studying whether people who spread "fake news" or disinformation and misinformation can be classified as cyber terrorists, similar to what is done in other countries.</p>
            <p>Presidential Communications Office Secretary Jay Ruiz said there is an ongoing study on whether they will move towards that direction, especially with what he calls a plague of disinformation now happening. He clarified however, that this will only apply to fake news peddlers whose posts affect national security or bigger issues that could affect the public.</p>
            <p>“Pinag-iisipan po namin ng DICT na ihanay sa mga cyber terrorist yung mga ganyang nagpapakalat ng sobrang masamang impormasyon sa utak ng ating mga kababayan,” he said.</p>
            <p>This comes as Ruiz led the opening of the Threat Monitoring Center of the Commission on Elections with the help of various agencies, including the Department of Information and Communications Technology.</p>
            <p>Comelec Commissioner Nelson Celis warned fake news peddlers that they have a way to check and determine the origin of fake news and that there is a prison sentence of up to 6 years for those proven guilty of spreading lies online.</p>
            <p>“Pagna-trace kayo mga troll farm kayo, mag-ingat kayo, magtago na kayo, umalis na kayo ng bansa dahil election offense po yan. One year ang pinakamababa, six years max. Matrace namin sino yung origin hanggang kumakalat. Meron kaming tools at ma trace naming troll farms niyo,” said Celis.</p>
            <p>However, officials also warned that one of the biggest threats is misinformation and disinformation coming from other countries or based overseas. They have monitored some of these cases and urged the public not to believe immediately in any social media posts from unknown or suspicious accounts.</p>
            <p>“Isa pang nakakabahalang kumakalat na balita sa Reuters tungkol sa mga foreign companies, mga nasa ibang bansa na nag mamanipulate ditto sa darating na halalan,” Ruiz said.</p>
            <p>DICT Asec. Aboy Paraiso added, “When you see fake news, we have tools to see where they came from and it’s outside interference that really hampers, threatens these elections.”</p>

            <p>ACG Director Brig. Gen. Bernard Yang said the group also rescued 11 minor victims of online sexual abuse and trafficking in persons in 159 operations.</p>
            <p>Yang said the operatives conducted nine entrapment operations against fake dentists, resulting in the arrest of 14 individuals, in coordination with the Philippine Dental Association.</p>

              <p>Yang said the suspect had no formal training or education in dentistry and was self-taught through online resources. Most of his clients were students who paid minimal fees for the procedures.</p>
            <p>He warned the public about the risks of getting procedures from unlicensed individuals, even if these cost cheaper.</p>
            <p>"These fake dentists offering service without a license can cause serious risks, including health complications, financial loss, the spread of infections, and long-term damage to your teeth. If you are aware of anyone offering unauthorized dental services, report it immediately to the nearest ACG office for appropriate action," he said. (PNA)</p>

            <p>With cybercrime incidents in the Philippines tripling to 10,004 in 2024, the need for stronger industry collaboration has never been more urgent.</p>
            <p>Recognizing this growing threat, CIBI Information Inc., the country’s first and only local credit bureau, has officially launched the Fraud Bureau, a pioneering initiative aimed at uniting the financial sector against fraud.</p>
            <p>According to the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC), the sharp increase in digital threats underscores the necessity for a coordinated, data-driven response.

            <p>MANILA, Philippines — Criminal charges were filed yesterday against a vlogger for allegedly spreading false information about a supposed police raid on the house of former president Rodrigo Duterte in Davao City.</p>
            <p>Members of the Davao City police and Anti-Cybercrime Group filed the complaint against the vlogger for allegedly violating Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code or the unlawful use of means of publication and unlawful utterances in relation to Republic Act 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act.</p>
            <p>The Philippine National Police withheld the identity of the vlogger, who posted on social media on April 30 that 30 members of the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group and 90 Special Action Force commandos raided the house of Duterte.</p>
            <p>Due to the false information, hundreds of Duterte’s supporters rushed to his property.</p>
            <p>Col. Randulf Tuano, PNP public information officer, said the PNP would disclose the vlogger’s identity once an arrest warrant is issued against the respondent.</p>

            <p>A new report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warns that scam calls originating in Asia have become a global problem, fueled by organized crime networks that have turned fraud into a multi-billion-dollar industry.</p>
            <p>The UNODC report, published today, highlights how Southeast Asian cybercrime groups, initially focused on regional targets, have expanded their operations worldwide, using advanced technology and human trafficking to scale their fraudulent activities.</p>
            <p>"These groups operate like multinational corporations, with sophisticated structures and global reach," the report states. It estimates that such scams generated $40 billion in 2024 alone, with call centers in countries like Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines playing a central role.</p>
            <p>The report also notes the role of forced labor, with tens of thousands of people trafficked into scam compounds, where they are coerced into making fraudulent calls under threat of violence.</p>

            <p>According to the UNODC, these operations, often based in countries like Cambodia, Laos, and the Philippines, have grown from local scams into a $40 billion industry in 2024, driven by advanced technology and the exploitation of trafficked labor.</p>
            <p>"The scale of these operations is unprecedented," said a UNODC spokesperson. "They use everything from fake investment schemes to romance scams, targeting victims globally through phone calls, text messages, and online platforms."</p>
            <p>The report also highlights the human cost, with an estimated 200,000 people trafficked into scam compounds across Southeast Asia, forced to perpetrate fraud under brutal conditions.</p>

            <p>MANILA – The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Tuesday warned the public against online scammers offering tour packages that appear too good to be true as the summer travel season peaks.</p>
            <p>PNP Chief Gen. Rommel Francisco Marbil issued the reminder as the police force’s Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG) arrested 45 persons for cybercrimes from April 11 to 17 in line with President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.’s directive to intensify the campaign against cybercrimes.</p>
            <p>“We urge everyone to verify the legitimacy of travel agencies and booking platforms before making any transactions,” Marbil said in a statement.</p>
            <p>“To cybercriminals preying on innocent citizens, especially during this peak travel season, be warned: the PNP is actively monitoring, patrolling, and ready to act. There will be no safe space for scammers in the digital world,” he added.</p>
            <p>The PNP-ACG conducted 313 cyber patrolling activities and carried out 13 digital forensic examinations from April 11 to 17, resulting in the arrest of 45, including 32 through entrapment operations.</p>
            <p>The ACG called on the public to stay vigilant and immediately report any suspicious or harmful online activity through the ACG’s official hotlines and verified social media accounts.</p>
            <p>Marbil said the PNP remains steadfast in its mission to ensure that every Filipino enjoys a safer and more secure cyberspace under the Bagong Pilipinas framework.</p>

        <div class="news-details">
            <p>MANILA: The Philippines has signed a new security agreement with the UAE to tackle transnational and organized crime, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>Signed by Philippine Interior Secretary Juanito Victor Remulla and UAE Interior Minister Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the new deal focuses on cybercrime, drug trafficking, and human trafficking.</p>
            <p>“Transnational crimes with global networks powered by new technologies and the ease of cross-border movement of persons and criminal syndicates need more international cooperation and partnerships,” Alfonso Ver, Philippine ambassador to the UAE, told Arab News on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>“This is one concrete step to address the growing menace above … We have gone into new and heretofore unexplored areas of bilateral cooperation, moving beyond the issues of OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers), migration, and oil,” Ver added.</p>
            <p>The Philippines and the UAE celebrated 50 years of diplomatic relations last year. The two countries have been working to expand security ties over the past few years, with discussions ongoing for a wide-ranging bilateral defense pact.</p>
            <p>In 2021, the Philippines posted a defense attache in the UAE, making it the only country in the Middle East where Manila has such representation. The two countries also signed several treaties on extradition, mutual legal assistance, and transfer of prisoners in February.</p>
            <p>Ver said the new agreement was a “milestone” that provides a “strategic framework” that will help guide Philippine-UAE “future engagements in a more structured, sustainable, and effective” manner. It is also expected to promote the exchange of best practices and expertise.</p>
            <p>“We discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations between the two friendly countries and develop cooperation in the security and police fields,” Sheikh Saif said in a post on X, referring to his meeting with Remulla.</p>
            <p>“This underscores our shared commitment to supporting effective international institutional cooperation to enhance the security and stability of societies,” he added.</p>
            <p>Cybercrime and trafficking have been growing concerns for countries like the Philippines. More than 200 Filipinos were among several thousand people freed in late February and March from online scam centers run by syndicates operating along Myanmar’s border with Thailand, where many of them are believed to have been recruited and trafficked by criminal gangs.</p>
            <p>Lured by well-paid job offers in Thailand, they were released in a weeks-long, highly publicized crackdown by Thai, Myanmar, and Chinese forces.</p>

            <p>MANILA – Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Henry Aguda on Monday endorsed a sweeping policy that targets online disinformation, cyber scams, and other online threats.</p>
            <p>The policy is part of the upcoming “Good Vibes sa Internet” initiative that aims to build a safer and more trustworthy online environment by eliminating digital threats and protecting the public from online abuse, according to a news release.</p>
            <p>“We must create a safer and more responsible cyberspace for every Filipino. We can no longer stand idly by as false information erodes the trust that binds our nation,” Aguda said during his first meeting with the executive committee as chair of the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC).</p>
            <p>The policy builds on the Cybercrime Prevention Act and introduces new measures such as the formation of a multi-agency task force to “swiftly respond” against online disinformation.</p>
            <p>“Through digital bayanihan (cooperation), the DICT will work closely with social media platforms, law enforcement, and civil society to detect and dismantle digital lies before they spread,” he said.</p>
            <p>Aside from disinformation or fake news, the policy will address the escalating threats of cyberterrorism by reclassifying certain cybercrimes as acts of cyberterrorism.</p>
            <p>“This move aims to deter malicious actors, recognize cybercrimes as continuing offenses, and strengthen national security and public safety in today’s increasingly digital landscape,” he said.</p>
            <p>Aguda said the policies form part of the government’s broader commitment to shaping an online space that “fosters meaningful engagement, upholds truth, and safeguards the collective well-being of every Filipino online.”</p>
            <p>“Cybercriminals must be held accountable with the full force of the law. We are taking a strong stance to ensure that the digital space is no place for fear, fraud, or extremism,” he said.</p>

            <p>Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Assistant Secretary Renato Paraiso said the council would meet later in the day to discuss the plan.</p>
            <p>"We're strengthening the CICC in terms of investigation and apprehension. The council, led by the DICT Secretary and joined by other agencies, will meet today to discuss forming a task force to crack down on online and text scams," Paraiso said in a televised interview.</p>
            <p>He also said the CICC is enhancing its Inter-Agency Response Center (I-ARC) Hotline 1326, where the public can report online scam incidents.</p>
            <p>According to Paraiso, while the SIM Card Registration Act has helped discourage text scams by removing anonymity, many scammers have adapted by shifting to online messaging apps that don't require SIM registration.</p>
            <p>"The SIM card registration removed their anonymity, but scammers have adapted. They no longer use calls or texts. They've moved to internet-based services like Viber and Messenger, which don't require valid SIM cards," he said.</p>
            <p>Paraiso reminded the public to stay alert for online scams, avoid clicking suspicious links, and never share one-time passwords (OTPs), which scammers can use to access financial accounts and records.</p>

        <div class="news-details">
            <p>During the third House Tri-Committee hearing on Friday, March 21, Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong (Lanao del Sur, 1st District) asked government agencies responsible for investigating false information on social media to explain how an ordinary citizen can report and navigate the process.</p>
            <p>Agencies with this capability include the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the PNP Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT).</p>
            <p>Many are familiar with the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act 10175), which penalizes online libel — defamatory statements made through digital platforms — under Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
            <p>However, police colonel Andres Simbajon Jr., deputy director for administration of the PNP-ACG, told the committee that "fake news" can still be legally addressed, as it is classified as a crime under the Revised Penal Code.</p>
            <p>One in particular is Article 154, which penalizes the "unlawful use of means of publication and unlawful utterances."</p>
            <p>The Revised Penal Code prescribes a penalty of arresto mayor — imprisonment ranging from one month and one day to six months — for unlawful publication perspective, this comes with an additional fine ranging from P40,000 to P200,000.</p>
            <p>Police lieutenant colonel Anacleto Daliva, assistant chief of the PNP-ACG's legal affairs division, explained that false information can also be penalized under the Cybercrime Prevention Act through Section 6, which covers crimes under the Revised Penal Code and special laws when committed through a computer system.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, core cybercrimes such as libel and online fraud fall under Section 4. "These are crimes where perpetrators use IT equipment, such as a cellphone or computer," Daliva said.</p>

            <p>MANILA, Philippines — Up to 126 people were arrested across the country in February for cybercrimes, the police Anti-Cybercrime Group reported yesterday.</p>
            <p>ACG director Brig. Gen. Bernard Yang said the figure is higher by 240.54 percent compared to the 37 people arrested in January.</p>
            <p>The suspects were apprehended in 132 law enforcement operations nationwide. Seven victims were rescued, the ACG said.</p>
            <p>Two other suspects, who are minors, were placed under the custody of social welfare officers.</p>
            <p>"The ACG remains steadfast in its commitment to enhancing efforts to combat cybercrime and ensure that criminals online are brought to justice," Yang said in a statement.</p>
            <p>He said 75 suspects were arrested in entrapment operations. Seven others were nabbed through the implementation of warrants to search, seize and examine computer data and 44 in the implementation of warrants of arrest.</p>
            <p>The top five offenses committed by the suspects are estafa, grave coercion, libel, violation of Republic Act 11934, the Subscriber Identity Module Registration Act, and RA 12010 or the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act.</p>
            <p>Yang urged the public to report to authorities people who are involved in cybercrimes.</p>

            <p>The report, released on Wednesday, highlighted that the Kingdom faced over 20 million cyber attacks last year, with phishing emails, ransomware, and online scams being the most common threats.</p>
            <p>"The rapid digital transformation in Saudi Arabia has made it a lucrative target for cybercriminals," said a Kaspersky spokesperson. The report noted that many attacks were linked to international crime syndicates operating out of Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.</p>
            <p>Saudi authorities have responded by strengthening cybersecurity measures, including public awareness campaigns and increased collaboration with global tech firms to combat digital fraud.</p>

            <p>MANILA – The Department of Justice's Office of Cybercrime and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) are in talks to collaborate in various projects to strengthen criminal justice, especially on the intensified enforcement of cybercrime laws in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>In a news release on Thursday, the DOJ said among the activities that the two agencies intend to undertake is increasing the government's pool of digital forensic experts and boosting their capacities of cybercrime investigators and prosecutors.</p>
            <p>DOJ Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla highlighted this need due to the steady increase in cybercrimes and cyber-enabled offenses or incidents in the country.</p>
            <p>To negotiate on the details of this partnership, Remulla will be leading a small delegation of DOJ officials to the UNODC headquarters in Vienna, Austria to sit down with its Executive Director, Ghada Fathi Waly.</p>
            <p>The delegation will also visit UNODC's Crime Laboratory.</p>
            <p>The meeting and visit will be conducted on the sidelines of the 68th Session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs on March 10 to 14.</p>
            <p>The DOJ said the activities are in line with the Marcos administration's commitment to human rights and the rule of law.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Undersecretary Jesse Hermogenes Andres, head of DOJ's Law Enforcement Cluster, is leading the conversations with UNODC's team in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>Andres said he envisions to institutionalize the government's ability to procure and utilize the necessary digital forensic tools and software applications used in cybercrime investigations.</p>
            <p>He said funding for the renewal of licenses of these important investigative tools must always be given priority.</p>
            <p>The DOJ and the UNODC are looking at signing a comprehensive memorandum of agreement to cover the various justice sector programs, including prison reform and forensics, in May this year. (PNA)</p>

            <p>Generative AI is starting to transform many sectors, both legitimate and illicit. Criminals have been early adopters, exploiting technology like deepfakes to turbo-charge existing methods to commit cybercrime and fraud—and invent entirely new ones. AI has made it increasingly challenging to verify the true identities of customers, investors, vendors, and even colleagues.</p>
            <p>Companies and their counsel need to understand how to avoid deepfake-related risks, how to address them effectively when they arise, and how to stay within the bounds of their ethical responsibilities. Our panel, comprised of both current and former government officials, will discuss:</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">• Deepfake fraud in the workplace, and knowing who you're talking to online</p>

        <p>The agency also announced P198 million in losses from the recorded cybercrime incidents.</p>
        <p>But this does not necessarily translate to a rise in cybercrime prevalence, as CICC Executive Director Alexander K. Ramos described the increase as an indicator of "growing cybercrime awareness of the public and their willingness to report".</p>

        <p>MANILA – The Department of Justice (DOJ) will embark on capacity-building this year to improve its anti-cybercrime efforts, according to a senior official.</p>
        <p>In an interview on PTV-4's "Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon" on Wednesday, DOJ Undersecretary Raul Vasquez said that for 2025, they will "take major strides in strengthening the DOJ's fight against cybercrime by conducting advanced technological and forensic trainings for its personnel and law enforcement units."</p>
        <p>The DOJ has an Office of Cybercrime (OOC) created under Republic Act No. 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 that serves as the central authority in all matters relating to international mutual assistance and extradition for cybercrime and cyber-related matters.</p>
        <p>The OOC also acts as "the focal agency in formulating and implementing law enforcement investigation and prosecution strategies in curbing cybercrime and cyber-related offenses nationwide," according to the DOJ.</p>
        <p>Vasquez made the statement following the arrest of a foreign national and two Filipinos suspected of engaging in months-long electronic intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance (ISR) operations in key military and civilian infrastructures in the country.</p>
        <p>The DOJ confirmed that it is pursuing other members of the group who may have procured equipment used in the eavesdropping operations, even as the military said it is monitoring the role played by Philippine Online Gaming Operators (POGOs) in the alleged spying activities.</p>
        <p>The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) on Wednesday likewise announced the arrest of eight foreigners in Parañaque City allegedly engaged in online phishing operations.</p>

        <p>A Malaysian national believed to be a key supplier of a device used in large-scale text scams was arrested in a joint operation by the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) and the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC).</p>
        <p>Authorities identified the suspect as the alleged leader of a syndicate selling International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers, electronic tools designed to trace and intercept mobile phone communications.</p>
        <p>The CICC began monitoring the suspect's company in October last year, carefully tracking its activities until they were certain of the suspect's involvement before executing the operation.</p>
        <p>IMSI catchers, also known as "Stingrays" or rogue cell towers, function by imitating legitimate cell towers to deceive nearby mobile devices into connecting with them. Once connected, the device collects IMSI numbers, enabling the operator to track location, monitor activity, and intercept text messages, calls, and data traffic.</p>
        <p>Investigators revealed that these devices are commonly used in text scams, tricking victims into sharing personal information and enabling large-scale fraud operations.</p>
        <p>"This arrest is a significant breakthrough in our fight against cybercrime and text scams that target the public," said a CICC representative.</p>
        <p>Authorities vowed to continue cracking down on syndicates using advanced technology to commit crimes, urging the public to remain vigilant against scams.</p>

        <p>MANILA – Operatives of the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) have arrested four persons involved in the illegal online sale of pre-registered subscriber identity module (SIM) cards in separate operations in Laguna province and Quezon City.</p>
        <p>In a statement Friday, ACG acting chief Brig. Gen. Bernard Yang said cyberpatrolling activities led to an engagement with the online sellers and their eventual arrest on Jan. 13 to 14.</p>
        <p>The Calabarzon police's anti-cybercrime unit spotted a suspect advertising online a bundle of a fully verified e-wallet account and a SIM card priced at PHP800.</p>
        <p>An officer arranged to meet up with the suspect and an accomplice, both of whom the ACG did not identify, which resulted in their arrest in Cabuyao town, Laguna at 4:40 p.m. on Jan. 13.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the ACG's Cyber Financial Crime Unit (CFCU) said another suspect, alias "JP," was selling an e-wallet account with an automated teller machine (ATM) card as well as an online banking account worth PHP3,000.</p>
        <p>The suspect was arrested after meeting up with a police officer who acted as a buyer along Mayon Street in Quezon City at around 12:58 p.m. on Jan. 14.</p>
        <p>Around 2:32 p.m. on the same date, the anti-cybercrime units of Northern Police District and Quezon City Police District arrested a suspect, alias Arvin, for selling his registered SIM card, along General Araneta Avenue in Cubao, Quezon City.</p>
        <p>The SIM card was linked to a verified e-wallet account and was priced at PHP2,300, the ACG said in a separate report.</p>
        <p>All four suspects were charged with violations of the SIM Registration Act, the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act, and the Cybercrime Prevention Act.</p>
        <p>The SIM card can be used for text scams or to create a social media account for scamming activities.</p>
        <p>Yang reminded the public that the illegal online sale of SIM cards is punishable by law, with significant fines and imprisonment.</p>
        <p>"It is crucial to adhere to the law and avoid involvement in such online illegal transactions to protect oneself and prevent the spread of cybercrime," he added. (PNA)</p>
